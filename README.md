# led-cube
This project is intended as a series of small modules/examples for teaching programming in Python, C++, and MATLAB (other languages can be easily added!). It provides building instructions and the corresponding code for a led cube made from 64x64 RGB led panels. With some creativity, the cube can display almost anything! To help with incorporation into larger classes, there is also a virtual simulation of the cube for students to use. Simply write code in your favorite language, and quickly visualize the results in the simulator.
